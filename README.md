# AbuseIPDB-Bulk-Scanner
Automated scanning


This python script (converted to .exe for usability) will automatically scan IPs in an excel sheet. It must be named "ips.csv" in the same directory, it will write it to a new CSV with all the IPs checked. 

The limit is up to your API key, you can input the key in the .env file. Make sure it's in the same directory.
